# mov-xchg-simulator

This project is a simple simulator for CPU instructions **MOV** and **XCHG**, designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

1. **MOV Instruction Simulation:**
   - Transfers data between registers (AX, BX, CX, DX).

2. **XCHG Instruction Simulation:**
   - Swaps data between two registers.

3. **Randomization and Reset:**
   - Random values can be assigned to registers.
   - Reset all registers to empty values.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Use the input fields to enter hexadecimal values for the registers.
3. Select source and target for operations from the dropdown menus.
4. Use the **MOV** and **XCHG** buttons to perform the respective operations.

## Future Extensions

- Add memory addressing and transfer between memory and registers.
- Add additional CPU instructions like PUSH, POP, etc.
- Enhance the interface for better user experience.
